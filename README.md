**Disclaimer:** This tool is for educational purposes only. Use only on systems you own or have explicit written permission to test.
    Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical.

# overview:

  purpose: Demonstrate how attackers capture keystrokes and help security professionals understand detection/prevention
  
  # objectives:
   - Monitor and log keyboard activity
   - Capture keystrokes with timestamps
   - Demonstrate keylogger functionality
   - Provide insights into detection techniques

## technical:

  # dependencies:
   
   - Python 3.6+
   - pynput library
   - Linux (Kali Linux tested)
    
  ## installation: 
  
   # Clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/educational-keylogger.git
    cd educational-keylogger

   # Install dependencies
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

  ## usage: |
  
   # Basic usage
    python3 keylogger.py

   # Advanced usage
    python3 keylogger.py --logfile custom_log.log --buffer 50

  command_line_options:
    - "--logfile: Specify custom log file path"
    - "--buffer: Set buffer size before writing to file"
    - "--email: Enable email reporting (disabled by default)"
    - "--stealth: Enable stealth mode"
