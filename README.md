# Keylogger Project - README

**Project Name**: Keylogger Creation 
  
  **Description**: Python-based keylogger for educational
  
  **Author:** Harish Babu G  
  
  **Date:** 2025-09-22
  
**Disclaimer:** This tool is for educational purposes only. Use only on systems you own or have explicit written permission to test.
    Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical.

# Overview:

**Purpose:** Demonstrate how attackers capture keystrokes and help security professionals understand detection/prevention
  
  # Objectives:
  
   - Monitor and log keyboard activity
   - Capture keystrokes with timestamps
   - Demonstrate keylogger functionality
   - Provide insights into detection techniques

  # Dependencies:
   
   - Python 3.6+
   - pynput library
   - Linux (Kali Linux tested)
    
  # Installation: 
  
   - Clone the repository
     
    `git clone https://github.com/your-username/educational-keylogger.git
    cd educational-keylogger`

   - Install dependencies
     
    `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

  # Usage: 
  
   - Basic usage
     
    `python3 keylogger.py`

 # Project_structure:

  - keylogger.py: Main keylogger implementation
  - keystrokes.log: Sample captured logs
  - Screenshots: Screenshots captured
  - README.md: Documentation
  - REPORT.md: Technical report

# Features:
   - Real-time keystroke capture
   - Timestamp logging
   - File-based storage
   - ESC key to stop execution
 
# Educational_objectives:
  - Understanding Attack Vectors
  - Detection Techniques
  - Prevention Strategies
  - Forensic Analysis

# Defensive_considerations:
  - Antivirus detection patterns
  - Behavioral analysis indicators
  - System monitoring techniques
  - User education importance
